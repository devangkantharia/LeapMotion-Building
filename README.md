# LeapMotion-Building
This is the second Unity game I made with the LeapMotion hand tracking device during Spring semester of 2016. This was a project to explore more capabilities the LeapMotion had, and to have some fun building things in a three dimensional virtual world with my hands in the real world. 

Cubes, cylinders, and spheres can be made, picked up, placed, and thrown. The color of each created object can be changed with a slider on the left palm, and the selected object can be changed with a slider on the right palm. Objects are made by pinching together both hands and moving out or in to increase/decrease scale.
